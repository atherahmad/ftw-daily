However, his social project lacked the necessary donations. Together we developed the idea of renting out the empty rooms of his house to travelers and letting them participate in the daily life of the village. Within three months, so many travelers visited Seng that he was able to build the school and hire an English teacher from the income.",
  "about.teamHeadline": "Our team",
  "about.teamTextBlock1": "The idea of using the enormous power of tourism to finance sustainable projects was something we could not let go of. Alongside our studies, we continued to pursue the idea over the years in a growing team. After overwhelming feedback from various projects and travelers, Alex & Nils from the team decided to found socialbnb as an independent social business in 2020.",
  "about.teamTextBlock2": "Since then, we have been growing steadily and working in a motivated team towards our goal of financing social and ecological projects worldwide in a sustainable way while creating authentic experiences for travelers at the same time.

As a result, they cannot implement their valuable work. However, some projects have rooms available that are a great fit as sustainable accommodation for travelers.

  "faq.headline1": "General",
  "faq.q1.q": "How does socialbnb work?",
  "faq.q1.a": "socialbnb is an innovative online platform that connects social and ecological projects with travelers from all over the world. Many of these projects have rooms that we offer on our platform as accommodations for travelers. This way, we not only create another source of funding for local projects that are committed to their community but also enable a unique and authentic experience for travelers. With the money spend on your accommodation, projects can realize their goals, such as building schools, planting trees, improving animal welfare, advocating for more equality and much more. After you have decided on an accommodation, you can submit a booking request via our site, which will then be confirmed by our partner project on site and you are ready to go. You can read more about the booking process here.",
  "faq.q2.q": "Who is behind socialbnb?",
  "faq.q2.a": "socialbnb is a social start-up from Cologne, Germany. Developed as a student initiative, it has now grown into an independent social start-up. The socialbnb team consists of enthusiastic travelers who share a passion for discovering different cultures. Every day we, together with our partner projects, work on our mission to create sustainable tourism, which benefits everyone.",
  "faq.q3.q": "What can I book on socialbnb?",
  "faq.q3.a": "On socialbnb.org you can book accommodations from social and ecological projects. While there are many large projects that work on an international level, socialbnb works with smaller and local projects that face great difficulty funding their work due to a lack of continuous donations. Most often, these projects are led by one person or a group of people driven by a common goal, solving social or environmental problems. These projects often have existing rooms that are very suitable for accommodating travelers. These can be located directly on the project site or in accommodations specifically designed for travelers, such as guesthouses, hostels or ecolodges.",
  "faq.q4.q": "What does the social in socialbnb stand for?",
  "faq.q4.a": "The social in our name is reflected on three levels. Firstly, our concept ensures the long-term financing of social and ecological projects. This makes tourism more sustainable and socially acceptable, as a large part of the local population benefits from the increased revenue. On the other hand, we want to offer a cultural exchange for travelers and create a fairer and social, as well as inclusive offer for everyone. But this aspect also plays a central role in our self-image. Because we see ourselves as a social start-up. This means that we want to achieve social added value and prioritize this over profit maximization. We are convinced that doing good and being profitable should not be mutually exclusive.",
  "faq.q5.q": "Why do you take a commission?",
  "faq.q5.a": "socialbnb has set itself the objective of financing social and ecological projects in the long term. For this, however, it is necessary that we also finance ourselves. Therefore, the socialbnb commission of 15% is used to cover our costs and to grow further. The amount is used to develop our platform, finance our team and for marketing activities to make more travelers aware of our offer. Despite our commission, it is completely free for projects to operate on the socialbnb platform in order to provide the best support possible. The commission is added to the stated price of the projects and paid as a deposit by the traveler. This commission also bears the idea of sustainability, because we want to maintain our work in the long term and for this, our costs must be covered. This way we can guarantee that we are active in the long term and can continue to work with projects and organizations worldwide. For a tourism that benefits everyone.",
  "faq.q6.q": "Can I recommend projects/organizations?",
  "faq.q6.a": "Absolutely! We are always happy to hear about new inspiring projects. If you have come across exciting projects on your journey or are involved in a project yourself, feel free to contact us at partner@socialbnb.de with your suggestion. We also love to hear from our existing partner projects if there are other projects or organizations in your community that we could collaborate with.",
  "faq.q7.q": "Sustainable tourism? Is that even possible?",
  "faq.q7.a": "We are convinced that it is. For us, sustainability means more than reducing the ecological footprint, even if that is a hugely important aspect. We see sustainability as a combination of the three aspects of ecology, social issues and economy. We want to promote exactly these three aspects with the help of our partner projects on site.

  "faq.q12.q": "Why booking request and not direct booking?",
  "faq.q12.a": "The availability of the accommodation can depend on various aspects. For example, some projects need the premises at short notice for their own staff or renovation work needs to be done on the premises. Other projects offer overnight accommodations that are regularly designated for volunteer housing. Therefore, the availability of the overnight accommodation depends on when and how many volunteers the organization expects. For these reasons, the projects must first check its internal availability before confirming your booking.",
  "faq.q13.q": "How does the project benefit from my booking?",
  "faq.q13.a": "YEEAH! This is definitely the best thing about booking with socialbnb. Since you are directly on site, you can see exactly where the money goes and what is accomplished with it.

You can find recent success stories in our newsletter and on our blog.",
  "faq.q14.q": "What are the room categories?",
  "faq.q14.a": "At socialbnb, there are six different room categories. These include: Single Room, Double Room (double bed), Twin Room (two single beds), Shared Room (three beds or more), Whole Accommodation (vacation home or bungalows) and Camping (tents, campers, hammocks). These differ in price and are marked with different accommodation symbols, as sometimes a project offers different room categories. Each room category is bookable through its own profile on socialbnb. You will find more information about the accommodation like if there is a shared or private bathroom through „About the accommodation„ and „Facilities„ on the profiles.",
    "faq.q15.q": "How many days in advance should I book?",
"faq.q15.a": "We recommend booking at least three to four days before your stay. Booking requests received only 48 hours before your stay are usually considered as well. The partner projects need some time to confirm and check if on site lodging is possible. Usually, you will receive an answer within 48 hours. If not, please send a message to your host.",
  "faq.q16.q": "What is the comfort level of the accommodation?",
  "faq.q16.a": "The comfort of the accommodation can vary depending on the project, country and region. Most of the accommodations are adapted to the regional conditions and therefore offer you an authentic insight into the culture of the region. In addition, many of our partner projects offer several accommodation categories with varying levels of comfort. Please note that for the majority of our partner projects, offering accommodation is not their main task. Therefore, the organizations do not always offer the same standard and service as hostels, hotels or other commercial accommodations. However, if you prefer accommodation with a higher level of comfort, you can view these accommodations using our filter function „High comfort„.",
  "faq.q17.q": "Is there a minimum length of stay?",
  "faq.q17.a": "socialbnb does not specify a minimum period for your stay. If the respective organization has set a minimum stay, you will find this information on their profile.

  "faq.q19.a": "You pay 15% of the price at the end of the booking by credit card or PayPal. This means only after the local partner project has confirmed the accommodation. The remaining amount will be paid directly at the project on site. This is done either in cash or by credit card.",
  "faq.q20.q": "Is it possible to volunteer?",
  "faq.q20.a": "We are glad that you want to help. However, socialbnb is not a website for placing volunteers at projects. We support these projects by providing them with a long-term funding alternative. Many of our partner projects have enough employees or interested people looking for work.  Often they just lack the funding to pay them fairly and to purchase working materials. Volunteer work can often have a negative impact on the local situation, especially if the volunteers can only be on site for a short time. There is usually not enough time to prepare the volunteers for their work and to train them to actually help. In order to be able to participate in projects, the employees must have certain qualifications, since work is often done with vulnerable target groups. In most cases, local employees have the knowledge and skills to solve local problems efficiently. Constantly changing employees disrupt the daily routine of the project target groups and hinder the efficiency of the project work. In addition, the supervision of volunteers is an increasing cost factor for the project, especially if they only work on site for a short period of time. So if you stay only a few days at a project, it is more effective to pay for your stay on site. However, in most cases, the contact person of the project will be happy to show you around the project and show their work if you are interested. In some cases, volunteering can also have a positive impact on the local situation. This can be the case, for example, in ecological projects where more help is needed. Requests for volunteering are therefore handled individually by us, and in consultation with the project.",
  "faq.q21.q": "What can I experience while staying at the project?",
  "faq.q21.a": "Staying at a socialbnb is a unique experience, so the range of activities varies from project to project. Check out the accommodation profiles on our website for more information about what there is to discover in the area around your accommodation. This includes guided tours as well as activities you can do on your own. You can also ask the project directly for further offers and tips. In addition, you can visit the project and find out how it creates social or ecological value on site. Please ask the project for more information when you are on site.",
  "faq.q22.q": "Can I get a discount If I volunteer at the project?",
  "faq.q22.a": "socialbnb wants to help social and ecological projects to get a long-term income. For the sustainability of the concept, it is important to pay the specified amount for your stay on site. It is not possible to get free accommodation in exchange for volunteering.",
  "faq.q23.q": "How can I make my trip more sustainable?",
  "faq.q23.a": "There are several ways to make your trip as sustainable as possible. In general, we recommend that everyone plan fewer trips per year and take them outside of the peak local season. It is also beneficial to visit the destinations longer and more intensively. The concept of Slow Travel encompasses this and is thus a contrast to mass tourism. It involves a conscious use of local resources and mindful behavior on site. It is often most sustainable if you travel off the beaten track. This way you support the economic growth of less touristic regions and contribute to the creation of new jobs. In addition, you get to know the country and its people in a completely new way. This way, you also contribute to a comprehensive sustainability, which also includes social and economic aspects. Always ask yourself if a flight is really necessary or if there are regional transport alternatives, such as night trains.

  "faq.q27.a": "The projects listed on our website cannot register on their own. They are first reviewed by our team members before you can book them on our website. After listing, a constant exchange with our project partners ensures that we are informed about the latest developments and the use of the funds.

  "faq.q30.a": "You have several ways to support the project even after your stay. To make more people aware of the project feel free to share your experiences with friends, families and other travelers you meet on your further journey. You can also rate the accommodation on our website after your stay and write a report about your experience. In this way you will contribute to more travelers being interested in the project and booking a stay as well. Another important aspect with which you can support the project is that you pass on your acquired knowledge through the work of the project and its message to other people. In this way, you will be contributing to the awareness of the importance of the issue that the project deals with. You may also want to write a blog post about your experience or have taken great pictures on site that you would like to share. Contact us for this at: blog@socialbnb.de",
  "faq.q31.q": "How can I give feedback on my overnight stay?",

Each project is checked against our criteria and works on at least one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, it is especially important to us to maintain a personal contact between our socialbnb team and the employees of the local projects . We therefore conduct in-depth personal interviews with the projects, where our experienced employees can get to know the projects and the people behind them and check the various quality standards. In this way, we can establish a personal connection and create a basis for good cooperation.",
  "faq.q34.q": "To what extent are the projects you work with sustainable?",
  "faq.q34.a": "Sustainability in our eyes includes three aspects, namely ecology, social and economy. All of our partner projects work to balance these three aspects. In addition, the work of the projects is in line with at least one of the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. All partner projects, whether ecological projects, social projects or animal welfare initiatives, strive for a long-term positive impact for the project target groups. Using our quality criteria, we assess in advance the extent to which this impact is also achieved through sustainable practices.",
  "faq.q35.q": "Is my trip insured?",
  "faq.q35.a": "As a platform our main function is to offer the opportunity of booking an accommodation and to connect with your host. All remaining aspects of your journey, like arrival and departure, are to be organized by yourself. We definitely recommend insuring you travel.",
  "faq.q36.q": "What do you do to ensure the safety of travelers?",
  "faq.q36.a": "At socialbnb, we have a security officer in our team who is informed about current entry restrictions, political riots, etc. worldwide and, if necessary, blocks certain travel areas on our website.",
  "faq.q37.q": "What should I do if I don't feel safe during a trip?",

  "faq.q38.q": "What do you contribute to the safety of the participants in your partner projects?",
  "faq.q38.a": "The positive impact of our work can only be achieved if the project target group is adequately protected on site. To this end, our first priority is to raise awareness. With the help of our Host Guidelines, we inform our partner projects about how to deal with travelers and explain that the project target group should be disturbed as little as possible in their daily routine by the stay of guests and that their safety has top priority. At the same time, we use our traveler guidelines to sensitize travelers to the fact that it is important for the project target group to be able to go about their daily routines and that there are certain protection aspects that must be fulfilled. These aspects can relate to general rules of conduct on site or to the orientation of the project. For example, there are projects that only accept women as guests. Here it is important for us to inform that women and children who are supported by these projects often had to go through traumatic experiences and partly experienced violence by men and therefore live in a protected environment.",
  "faq.q39.q": "Am I allowed to take photos/vlogs/videos at all projects?",
  "faq.q39.a": "People participating in the work within the partner projects may only be photographed and filmed with their consent. Please always ask In advance If taking photos is okay.

Accommodations that fulfill aspects of accessibility can be searched for using the filter „partly barrier-free„.

  "faq.q48.a": "The amount for accommodation should be based on local prices for hostels and hotels and is determined by you.

Since the price on our website can only be given in dollars, please convert your price yourself and then round the sum up or down.

Otherwise, feel free to use the partner@socialbnb.de mail.",
  "faq.q51.q": "Is the use free of charge for me?",
  "faq.q51.a": "Yes, the use is free of charge for you. If you get a booking, we get a commission of 15% of your price per night. This commission will be added to your price, so you don't pay any money.",

  "faq.q53.q": "My accommodation is accessible for people with impairments. What do I have to consider?",
  "faq.q53.a": "Please note that there are a variety of impairments (e.g. mobile limitations, sensory impairments, etc.), thus the environment must be designed very differently for barrier-free usage. In addition, the impairment can vary greatly depending on the person, which is why each person can best assess for themselves which accessibility requirements must be met. For this reason, it is of very high relevance to provide travelers with comprehensive information regarding the accessibility of your accommodation. We therefore, ask you to describe the type and implementation of accessibility in your accommodation in detail when creating your profile and, in the best case, to illustrate this with photos. You can find more information about this in the guideline for profile creation.",
  "faq.q54.q": "Can I offer additional activities?",
  "faq.q54.a": "Of course you can offer activities for the travelers. You can list them in your profile in the Activities section.

  "faq.q55.q": "What kind of activities are supported?",
  "faq.q55.a": "In principle, all activities are allowed that can be carried out with respect for human rights and the protection of the environment and animals. In order to protect animals, no activities should be offered that involve direct contact between travelers and wildlife. This includes horseback riding (e.g., elephant riding and dolphin riding), feeding and petting wildlife. In addition, visits to animal shows, zoos and dolphinaria are incompatible with the protection of wildlife and should therefore generally not be recommended, especially through our site.",
  "faq.q56.q": "What am I supposed to show the traveler about the project?",
  "faq.q56.a": "Many of the travelers are very interested in local solutions to global challenges and want to know what positive impact their overnight stay will have on site. A project tour can be an impressive addition to the stay at your project. Of course, this should only be done in line with your daily work and should not prevent you from doing so. If guided tours of the project are not possible, feel free to talk about the project and your work. Here, for the extent always applies: as much exchange as is wanted by both sides.",
  "faq.q57.q": "Can I find volunteers through the platform?",
  "faq.q57.a": "socialbnb is a website that provides accommodation to travelers. We are not a platform for volunteering. You should therefore not integrate your guests into your daily routine or expect a work performance."
